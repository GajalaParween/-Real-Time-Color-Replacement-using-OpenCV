# -Real-Time-Color-Replacement-using-OpenCV
I recently built an exciting Computer Vision project using Python and OpenCV — a Real-Time Color Replacement Tool that lets you dynamically replace any color in your webcam feed using adjustable HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) ranges and BGR sliders.

Includes options to:
🎚 Adjust HSV & replacement color live
⏸ Pause and resume detection
💾 Save snapshots
🧼 Clean masks using morphological operations for smooth results
💡 Key Concepts
HSV color segmentation
Bitwise masking & color blending
Morphological transformations (Open & Close)
Real-time video processing with OpenCV
